Checkerboard tiling with python and dancing links.

This is an experiment in using the python implementation of Knuth's Algorithm X,
posted at http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~aassaf9/python/algorithm_x.html by 
Ali Assaf. I did a python implementation using dicts myself, many years ago,
but I'm certain it wasn't this elegant.

I'm scratching an old itch by exercising the algorithm on an old puzzle.  One is
given a checkerboard that has beenbroken in 12 pieces, and the problem is to 
reassemble it.  More than 50 years ago, I bought this as a plastic puzzle, and
was never able to do it.  A years or so ago, I ran across the solution on line, which,
of course shwos the shapes of the pieces.  I've been meaning to solve the puzzle
with dancing links, and this is a good excuse.

The solution I found online is shown in the file solution.jpg
